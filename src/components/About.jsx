          Hi! My name is Derek Sego (See-Go). I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in psychology. I have spent the last 20 years helping my family build a successful business in the childcare industry. I have done everything from maintenance to managing 40 employees and dealing with everything that is involved with clients and employees. I'm looking for a new position in the tech industry. I'm looking for a position where I can use my skills to help build a positive impact on the world.
